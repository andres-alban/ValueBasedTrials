Value-based clinical trials are designed to maximize the expected net gain. This app allows you to 
- select the parameters of your trial, 
- visualize the expected net gain, V(T,r) as a function of the recruitment duration, T, and recruitment rate, r, 
- compute the recruitment rate and duration that maximize the expected net gain.
